            <h2>What is Deep Learning?</h2>
            <p class="date">March 11, 2014</p>
            <p class="main-text">Deep learning (also called deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is a kind
                of machine
                learning, which is mostly used with certain kinds of neural networks. As with other kinds of
                machine-learning, learning sessions can be unsupervised, semi-supervised, or supervised. In many
                cases, structures are organised so that there is at least one intermediate layer (or hidden layer),
                between the input layer and the output layer.</p>

                <p class="main-text">
                    Brackets is a <strong>powerful</strong> and modern text editor. We blend visual tools into the
                    editor
                    so you get
                    the right amount of help when you want it without getting in the way of your creative process.
                    You'll
                    enjoy
                    writing code in Brackets.

                    Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling,
                    like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.
                    <br> <br>
                    First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless
                    edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on
                    your ideas
